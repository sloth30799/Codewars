// It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

function removeChar(str){
    str = str.split('')
    str.pop()
    str.shift()
    return str.join('')
  };

  
//   better
const removeChar = str => str.slice(1,-1)
