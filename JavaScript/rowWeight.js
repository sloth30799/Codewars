// Scenario
// Several people are standing in a row divided into two teams.
// The first person goes into team 1, the second goes into team 2, the third goes into team 1, and so on.

// Task
// Given an array of positive integers (the weights of the people), return a new array/tuple of two integers, where the first one is the total weight of team 1, and the second one is the total weight of team 2.

// Notes
// Array size is at least 1.
// All numbers will be positive.
// Input >> Output Examples
// rowWeights([13, 27, 49])  ==>  return (62, 27)
// Explanation:
// The first element 62 is the total weight of team 1, and the second element 27 is the total weight of team 2.

function rowWeights(array){
    return array.reduce(([fir, sec], x, index) => {
      if (index % 2 === 0) {
        fir += x
      } else {
        sec += x
      }
      return [fir, sec]
    }, [0, 0])
  }
